# About
### This folder contains various categories of challenges
---
To try out a challenge, paste the code from the desired challenge into your browsers console.

> What is the console? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools

> How do I open the console??????? https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/

> Are the scripts malicious? No, they are not. I have included comments in all of the scripts and you can review the code or ask someone to check. If you dont trust it, don't use it.

> "This challenge was made for x.x.x but the game has updated" What is this??? All the scripts check to see if the game has updated. If so, they will not run as things could have changed. They will be updated so you will have to wait.

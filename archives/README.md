# map
Under the `map` folder you will find archives of all the map's wall data. They are sorted into folders with the follwoing format `REGION-GAMEMODE`.

The files names are the dates (EST) when the archives were taken. When using the data, make sure to remember that the `x` and `y` are the center of the shape and not the top left.

### Interesting information:
* The map size is 7000x7000
* There are 750 walls on every map
* 200 of these walls are blue/`longCrate`s
* 550 of these walls are brown/`crate`s
* Blue walls/`longCrate`s only spawn within 1000, 1000, to 6000, 6000
* In all `DOM` maps, the bottom left point/base always has empty space going straight down to the border

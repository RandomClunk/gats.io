### About
This folder contains various user-scripts that do various things. To use the scripts, you must have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
Once you have installed Tampermonkey, click on the script that you want.
Next, press the <kbd>Raw</kbd> button and tampermonkey should detect the `.user.js` file extension and prompt you to install the script.
***
#### Note: scripts with a * beside their name need to be run from the console and not tampermonkey. You can learn more about the console [here](../challenges#faq)
